===

One on the most simple zombie survival games EVER! (With super easy controls too)

## I CAN HAS CONTROL? ##

#### Yea, sure... It's super easy, just read on! ####

* `[W][A][S][D]` or `Arrow keys` to move around.
* Press `[ENTER]` to chat (Or rather to focus on the textbox).
* Click random on your keyboard to type some message look-a-like-thingie.
* Press `[ENTER]` again to send your awesome newborn message.
* Or do an `[ESC]` to cancel every single awesome character in the textbox, and return to the game.



## Thanks dude! But I kinda need some info about the game too? ##

* `Human look-a-like`?
	* Well, this is either you, or the other players... (It's not always easy to tell the difference)
* `A green man whom's brain is trying to get out`?
	* You should try to keep away from those, they're evil evil creators called `Zombies`.
* `Red'n'White pill`?
	* Although it look a bit like posion, it's not! You should eat these, as soon as you find them! As they help you survive.
* `Big blue square with random text in it`?
	* If you're about to die, you should go here as fast as possible! It'll help you regenerate your life.



## I have some weird colored sweatband on my forehead? ##
This both indicates your life, and your color...

Ohh and btw, it's not a sweatband, it's your actual forehead!



## And if I by any chance would die? ##

Well, that's the tricky part, and most people tend to be every confused in this situation.
But fear not!
If you die, just wait about 10 seconds, and you'll feel as good as a baby hamster being fed by a rooster!
